### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Megan. Welcome to my Github! 

I am a full-stack web developer. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley in sociology and decided to make a bigger leap to learn programming. I spend a lot of time brainstorming ideas and always try to create something. When I learn something and understand, I would write a blog to keep my memory fresh.

My motivation for coding is fairly simple and it's somewhat related to my college major. I have become an advocate for a lot of the social issues in recent years, including racism. I learned web developing because I want to code for good. Web developing is very versatile and is one of the most common and fast-growing demand skills. I would like to be the go-to person among friends or anyone who needs a website. You'll find me constantly learning new technologies and that's what I love about the tech community. It's hard to get sick of it and I can talk about it all day long.

Technical skills: Javascript, ReactJS, Ruby On Rails, Ruby, Git

- 🌱 I’m learning MERN, React's Hooks and Redux
- 👯 I want to be better at website designs and building backend API🥸.
- 💬 Ask me about Hong Kong🇭🇰, Snoopy, swimming🏊🏻‍♀️, japanese stationaries, sitcoms
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-s-lo/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/megmehlol)
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I buy stationaries, I only look for stationaries that are refillable; I was a competitive swimmer from the age of 5 to 15.
