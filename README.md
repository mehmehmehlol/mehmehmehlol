### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Megan. Welcome to... #MeganLand!

I am a full-stack web developer. I recently graduated from UC Berkeley in sociology and decided to make a bigger leap to learn programming. I spend a lot of time brainstorming ideas and always try to create something. When I learn something and understand, I would write a blog about it to keep my memory fresh.

I am one of those people that would spend 2 days just working on the CSS of that one freaking button!!! But it's okay, I like it regardless. I prefer minimalist and simplicity with my website design, however, I just started learning. So, even I have a cool idea in my head, I am still working on implementing those ideas onto my website.

Technical skills: Javascript, ReactJS, Ruby On Rails, Ruby, Git

- 🌱 I’m learning MERN, React's Hooks and Redux
- 👯 I want to be better at website designs🥸.
- 💬 Ask me about Hong Kong🇭🇰, Snoopy, swimming🏊🏻‍♀️, japanese stationaries, sitcoms
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-s-lo/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/megmehlol)
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I buy stationaries, I only look for stationaries that are refillable; I was a competitive swimmer from the age of 5 to 15.
