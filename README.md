### Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 👩🏻‍💻I’m currently working on some minor projects and polishing my past projects, nothing biggie🤪
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Hooks, Redux, Bootstrap, PHP and Java
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on improving my project designs and extend my knowledge🥸.
- 💬 Ask me about Hong Kong🇭🇰, Snoopy, swimming🏊🏻‍♀️, japanese stationaries, sitcoms
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-s-lo/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/megmehlol)
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I buy stationaries, I only look for stationaries that are refillable; one of my dreams is to have a big shelf full of Snoopys.
